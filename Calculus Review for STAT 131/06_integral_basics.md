In this section, we review some integration basics. Integration is
fundamentally the reverse process of differentiation. While
differentiation finds the rate of change, integration sums up small
quantities to find a total.

## Integration Basics

### Definite Integral

The definite integral calculates the accumulated value between two
points $a$ and $b$. The result is a **number**.

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
$$

- $dx$ tells you which variable you are integrating. It also implies
  that everything else is considered as constants.
- $a$ and $b$ are the lower and upper limit of integration.

Integration has a geometric interpretation: The definite integral
$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$ represents the signed area between the curve
$f(x)$ and the x-axis from $x=a$ to $x=b$.

e.g.) The shaded area below corresponds to the definite integral
$\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx$.

### Variable Limits

The limit of the integral can also be a variable. When the limit of
integration is a variable, the integral defines a new function

$$
F(x)=\int_a^x f(t) \, dt.
$$

$F(x)$ represents the accumulated area under the curve $f(t)$ from a
fixed starting point $a$ up to a moving endpoint $x$. Note that we
switch the variable inside the integral to a “dummy variable” $t$ to
avoid confusing it with the limit $x$.

We can also differentiate $F(x)$:

**The Basic Rule:** The derivative of the integral recovers the original
function.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) \, dt = f(x) $$

The limit of the integral can even be a function $g(x)$. To
differentiate it, we apply the chain rule:

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^{g(x)} f(t) \, dt = f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) $$

Note: Try to verify this result yourself. It can help with the
understanding of chain rule.

### The Indefinite Integral

An indefinite integral represents the general “antiderivative” of a
function. It essentially asks the question: “Which function $F(x)$, when
differentiated, gives me $f(x)$?”

$$ \int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C $$

- $F(x)$: The “antiderivative” function.
- $C$: The Constant of Integration.

We need the $+C$ because the derivative of any constant is zero, and
there are infinitely many functions that could be the answer (e.g.,
$x^2$, $x^2 + 5$, $x^2 - 100$ all differentiate to $2x$). We represent
this entire “family of functions” by adding an arbitrary constant $C$.

- Note that an indefinite integral returns a **function**, whereas a
  definite integral returns a **number**.

### Calculating Definite Integrals

To solve a definite integral, we use the **Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus**. This theorem links the area under a curve to the
antiderivative.

If $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$, then:

$$ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a) $$

To calculate a definite integral, there are essentially three steps:

1.  Integrate: Find the indefinite integral $F(x)$ (you can ignore the
    $+C$).
2.  Evaluate: Plug in the upper limit $b$ and the lower limit $a$.
3.  Subtract: Calculate Top minus Bottom.

**Notation**: We often use a vertical bar or bracket to denote the
evaluation step:

$$ \left[ F(x) \right]_a^b = F(b) - F(a) $$

e.g.)

$$ \int_0^3 x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^3 = \frac{3^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = 9 - 0 = 9 $$

## Integrals of Simple Functions

It is helpful to memorize well the indefinite integrals of some common
functions.

### The Constant Function

$$
\int c \, dx = cx + C
$$

### The Power Function

This is the reverse of the derivative power rule. Instead of multiplying
and subtracting, you add and divide.

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C
$$

**Note:** This rule applies for all $n \neq -1$.

### The Reciprocal Function

When $n = -1$, the power rule fails. This is the special case that
yields the natural logarithm.

$$
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \log|x| + C
$$

### The Exponential Function

The Natural Exponential $e^x$

$$
\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C
$$

- With a constant coefficient $e^{kx}$: $$
    \int e^{kx} \, dx = \frac{1}{k}e^{kx} + C
    $$

The General Exponential $a^x$

$$
\int a^x \, dx = \frac{a^x}{\log(a)} + C
$$

### Trigonometric Functions

$$
\int \sin(x) \, dx = -\cos(x) + C
$$ $$
\int \cos(x) \, dx = \sin(x) + C
$$

Be careful with the signs!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic Properties

Like differentiation, integration is a linear operator, meaning it also
handles constants and sums predictably.

### Function multiplied by constants

You can pull constants outside the integral sign.

$$
\int c \cdot f(x) \, dx = c \cdot \int f(x) \, dx
$$

Again, it is crucial to always keep in mind what is the variable and
what are the constants. It is a useful practice to first pull all the
constants outside of the integral before calculation.

### Sum of functions

The integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals.

$$
\int [f(x) + g(x)] \, dx = \int f(x) \, dx + \int g(x) \, dx
$$

Note: There is **no** simple “Product Rule” or “Quotient Rule” for
integrals. Products usually require *Integration by Parts*, which we
will cover in the next section.
